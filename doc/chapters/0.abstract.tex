Reactive Programming is a way of programming designed to provide
developers with the right abstractions for creating systems that use
streams of data.  Traditional debug tools lack support for the
abstractions provided, causing developers to fallback to the most
rudimentary debug tool available:  \printfdebugging{}.

In this work, we design a visualization and debugging tool for Reactive
Programming, that aids comprehension and debugging of reactive systems,
by visualizing the dependencies and structure of the data flow, and the
data inside the flow.  We present RxFiddle, a platform for the
visualization as well as the required instrumentation for RxJS in the
ReactiveX-family of Reactive Programming libraries.  Evaluation based on
an experiment with 111 subjects, shows that RxFiddle can outperform
traditional debugging in terms of debug time required.
