To answer our research questions, we employ a three-phase Sequential
Exploratory Strategy, one of the mixed methods research approaches~\cite
{creswell2013research,hanson2005mixed}, as shown in Table~%
\ref{research-methods}.  First, we interview professional developers and
review available documentation (RQ1) to form a understanding about
current debugging practices, second we apply this understanding to
design a debugger and implement it to test its feasibility (RQ2),
finally we validate the debugger using an experiment (RQ3).
