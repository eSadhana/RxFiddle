\section{RP Debugging practices}%
\label{section-practices}

To validate the need for better tools we must first understand how
existing tools are used (RQ1).  We interview developers, as we want to
explore and understand the current practices, instead of using an
experiment or survey to test a particular hypothesis.  The questions
were semi-structured.  We first established a general understanding of
the experience of the subjects.  Then we asked several open questions
regarding use of RP, how subjects debug RP and test RP.  Table%
\ref{interview-questions} lists the questions used as a guideline for
the interviews.

Five developers with professional programming experience ranging from 4
to 12 years were interviewed.  The first four developers (D1-D4) work
in Company A, which builds mostly reactive systems~\cite{boner2014reactive}
using various RP solutions. Developers range from a month to over a
year of Rx experience.  The fifth developer (D5) works in Company B, and
is concerned with building and maintaining a large scale distributed
server application, that uses Rx to handle asynchronous events.

\subsection{Interviews} In the following paragraphs we discuss the
results of Q6-Q10 in detail.  Not every subject answered each question
in the same amount of detail, so we discuss the answers that provide
meaningful insights in the current practice.

\paragraph{Testing} Of the 4 subjects of Company A, none performed tests
specifically for Rx logic.  \emph{``Just running the application''}, is
enough according to D3, saying that they only test the business logic in
their application and consider the Rx code as ``glue''' which either
works or does not work.  In contrast, D5 and his team at Company B
extensively tests their application using the Rx' built-in test
facilities like ``marble tests'' and the \code{TestScheduler}~\cite{reactivex}.
Using tests, the subject \emph{confirms his believes about the behavior}
of the chain of operators, and tests also help later on when refactoring
code.

\paragraph{Debugging} All subjects independently mention using temporary
\printfdebugging{} statements (\code{console.log} in JavaScript).
Subjects use \printfdebugging{} to \emph{``add more context''} (D1) to
their debug sessions.  Printing which values flow through the flow
allows them to \emph{``quickly reason what happens''} (D3).  Breakpoints
are only used when the project requires costly (TypeScript) recompilation 
if the source is modified, as required for \printfdebugging{} (D1).

Existing debuggers often can not be used to inspect the life-cycle of
Observables (subscription and disposal), as these occurrences are not
normally defined in user code and would require breakpoints in library
code, like the \code{subscribe}-method, which is used by all class
instances of Observable.  This debugging inside the Rx library was
described as \emph{``painful''} by D2, when using the Node.js debugger
to step through the inners of Rx.  Alternatives used by our subjects are
(1) creating a \emph{custom \code{debug}-operator} which prints these
life-cycle events (D5) or (2) creating custom Observables (\code{Observable.create})
with \emph{custom \code{subscribe}- and \code{dispose}-methods}, inserted at the
beginning of the chain, that print upon their usage (D2, D5).  While
\printfdebugging{} and breakpoints are useful in various degrees when
executing a single Observable chain, these methods both become
considerably more difficult and \emph{``overview is easily lost''} when
executing multiple chains concurrently (D3, D5).

\paragraph{Documentation} Subjects give different reasons to visit the
documentation, but the most common reason is to \emph{``find an operator
for what I need''} (D1).  They feel that there might be an operator that
precisely matches their needs, however knowing all operators by heart is
not common (the Rx's Observable API has 28 static methods and 114
instance methods), therefore subjects sometimes end up doing an
extensive search for some specific operator.  Another reason to visit
the documentation is to \emph{comprehend how operators in existing code
work}.  For this, subjects use the Marble Diagrams at \href{http://rxmarbles.com}
{RxMarbles.com}~\cite{rxmarbles} (D2, D5), the RxJS 4 documentation at
\href{https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/} {GitHub}
(D2, D5), the RxJS 5 documentation at \href{http://reactivex.io/rxjs} {ReactiveX.io}~\cite
{reactivex} (D1, D4, D5) and the online book \href{http://introtorx.com}
{IntroToRx.com}~\cite{introtorx} (D4).  D1 specifically mentions the
need for more examples in the documentation.

\paragraph{Difficulties experienced} The IDE does not help with
developing Rx (D2, D4); according to D4 \emph{``Rx is more about timing
than about types''}, and \emph{``You miss some sort of indication that
the output is what you expect''}.  It is not always clear what happens
when you execute a piece of code, ``mostly due to Observables sometimes
being lazy'' (D2).  Flows are clear and comprehensible in the scope of a
single class or function, but for applicationwide flows it becomes
unclear (D3, D4 and D5).  D3 mostly used RxScala and mentions that
creating micro services helps in this regard.  D1 mentions that \emph{``you
need to know a lot as a starting {\lbrack}RxJS{\rbrack} developer''},
giving the example of the many ways to cleanup and \code{unsubscribe},
which he did manually initially.  D1 used both logging while analyzing
existing code and learning to overcome inexperience.

\paragraph{Understanding} Subjects first \emph{look at which
operators are used}, then they \emph{reason about what types and values
might flow through the stream} (D2, D3, D4 and D5), using various
methods.  By analyzing the variable names D2 forms an expectation of the
resulting value types, then reasoning backwards, to see how this data is
derived.  \emph{Running the code}, is used when possible by D5, to
observe the outcome of the stream, as this ``shows the intentions of the
original developer''.  If it remains unclear how the data is
transformed, the subject adds his \code{debug}-operator or looks up
operators in the documentation.

\subsection{Analysis of Literature} Developers can learn Rx through
several sources such as the official documentation at \href{http://reactivex.io}
{ReactiveX.io}, books, online courses and from the many blog posts
available.  We gathered resources to be analyzed by selecting 4 popular
books about Rx, and complement this with the official documentations and
an article by a core contributor of RxJS.  All reviewed resources either
mention debugging briefly and suggest using the \code{do}-operator for
\printfdebugging{}, or teach the developer \printfdebugging{} via code
samples.

The RxJS 4 documentation%
\footnote{ \url{https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/gettingstarted/testing.md}
} and two books~\cite{esposito2016reactive,rxjavabook2016} propose the
use of the \code{do}-operator for debugging.  Esposito and Ciceri~\cite{esposito2016reactive}
further explain how to best format the log statements and introduce ways
to limit the logging by modifying the Observable through means of
throttling and sampling.  The RxJava book~\cite{rxjavabook2016} also
contains tips to use the various \code{do}-operators to integrate with
existing metric tools.  To our knowledge the only article%
\footnote{\url{http://staltz.com/how-to-debug-rxjs-code.html}} addressing
issues of debugging Rx is by Staltz, one of the contributors of RxJS, noting
that conventional debuggers are not suitable for the higher level of
abstraction of Observables.  Staltz explains three current ways to debug
Rx, being:  (1) tracing to the console, (2) manually drawing the
dependency graph, (3) manually drawing Marble Diagrams.

We analyzed a set of 13 books about RxJS, which was created by selecting
69 books matching ``RxJS'' from the O'Reilly Safari catalogue%
\footnote{\url{http://www.safaribooksonline.com}}, and further reducing
the set by filtering on the terms ``debug'' and ``debugger''.  While,
none of the remaining books had a chapter about debugging, many of these
books use \printfdebugging{} in their code samples.  Notably, 
Blackheath~\cite{frpbook2016} suggests, in a ``Future Directions'' chapter, 
that special debuggers could provide a graphical representation of FRP
state over time and would allow debugging without stepping into the FRP engine.

\subsection{Overview of practices} The available literature matches the
results of the interviews:  \printfdebugging{} is commonly advised and
used.  While the conventional debugger works in some cases, this is
mostly the case for the procedural logic that interleaves Rx logic.
Automated tooling is suggested, but is not implemented.  We see that
developers use \printfdebugging{} to learn the behavior of Observables,
behavior meaning both their values flowing through and their (one or
many) subscriptions.

Overall, we identified four overarching practices when debugging Rx code:
\begin{enumerate}
        \itemsep0em
    \item[(1)]
        Gaining high-level overview of the reactive structure.
    \item[(2)]
        Understanding dependencies between Observables.
    \item[(3)]
        Finding bugs and issues in reactive behavior.
    \item[(4)]
        Comprehending behavior of operators in existing code.
\end{enumerate}
