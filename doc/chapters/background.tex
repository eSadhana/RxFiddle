\paragraph{Marble Diagram}
\label{marblediagram}
The term \textit{Marble Diagram} comes from the shape of the glyps in the images used to explain Rx in the official documentation. 
The diagrams contain one or more timelines containing the events that enter and leave Observables. 
Next-events are typically represented with a circle, an error-event with a cross and a complete-event with a vertical line.
Developers can see from the diagram how operators work by inspecting the difference between the timelines, 
where events might be skipped, added, transformed or delayed. 
Mapping time on the x-axis provides insight that is missing when inspecting only a single time slice.
