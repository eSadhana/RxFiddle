\section{Research Design}
To answer our research questions we employ a mixed methods research approach as shown in Table~\ref{research-methods}.
First we interview professional developers and review available documentation (RQ1) to form a understanding about current debugging practices,
then we apply this understanding to design a debugger and implement it to test its feasibility (RQ2),
finally we validate the debugger using an experiment (RQ3).
