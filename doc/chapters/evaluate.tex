\section{Evaluation}
For our RQ3, to validate our ideas about the debugger we designed an experiment to measure the (potential) speed up achieved with RxFiddle compared to the alternative of using the built-in Chrome Debugger.

\subsection{Experimental setup}

\todov{
controlled experiment at company
uncontrolled experiment online at RxFiddle.net
experiment includes:
- self assessment of programming skill
- self assessment of RP skill
- instruction video's
- non-question in question setting to familiarize with tooling
- warm-up question
- 3 questions involving different understanding/bugs:
  1. learning operator behavior (BMI sample)
  2. root cause analysis of crash
  3. analysis of timing bug, caused by wrong operator usage
}

\subsection{Results}

\todov{
techniques to look into:
Wilcoxon
Cohen delta (normal) / Cliffs delta (non-normal)
check if normal distribution: Shapiro Wilks
}
