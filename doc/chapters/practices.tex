\section{RP Debugging practices}
%\todo{alternative section titles: Evaluating motivation / collecting empirical evidence / case study}
To validate the need for better tools we must first understand what existing tools are used (RQ1).
We interview developers as we want to explore and understand the current practices, instead of using an experiment or survey to test a particular hypothesis.
A controlled experiment to verify some hypothesis formed from literature could fail to include any practices employed that we did not consider.
The questions were semi-structured and first established a general understanding of the experience of the subject. 
Then we asked several open questions regarding use of RP, how subjects debug RP and test RP. Table \ref{interview-questions} lists the questions used a guideline for the interviews.

Q6  & Did you and how did you test or verify the workings of RP code? \\ \hline
Q7  & Did you and how did you debug RP code?                          \\ \hline
Q8  & Did you and how did you use documentation on RP?                \\ \hline
Q9  & What difficulties did you experience with RP?                   \\ \hline
Q10 & What is your general approach to understand a piece of Rx?      \\ \hline

\subsection{Literature and written work}
By examining resources available to developers we explore what are recommended debugging practices and compare this to what we found during the interviews.
\todo{
\begin{itemize}
	\item clues in books: recent book (2016) on RP by Esposito and Ciceri~\cite{esposito2016reactive}, has chapter `Debugging' which solely consists of ways to print to the console and how to transform streams (by writing code) that are more easily printed.
	\item article by Stalz on how to debug\footnote{http://staltz.com/how-to-debug-rxjs-code.html}: iterates that there are 3 main ways: drawing the dependency graph, drawing marble diagrams, tracing to the console.
	\item Official documentation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/gettingstarted/testing.md\#debugging-your-rx-application}}: use \code{do}-operator to add tracing to console.
\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Interviews}
\todo{
Performed interviews in a professional setting. Questions asked include `how do you debug Rx', `how do you test Rx'. Answers gathered, using cards method, categorized to concepts.

%\todo{problem, solution, why choices made, motivate the choices}
%As discussed in Section ref{background}, much has been written about comprehension \& debugging programs in traditional settings, but little is known specific to RP. The fact that tooling like debuggers were designed for imperative languages suggests that the current debuggers might not be optimal for RP.
%
%Salvaneschi et al.~\cite{salvaneschi2016debugging} report that students use . This suggestion is strengthened by the experience of the first author in a professional setting that developers struggle with debugging Rx, sprinkling the code with \code{println}-statements in order to gain insight in the runtime behavior, instead of using standard features like breakpoints and stepping.

%The research is motivated by multiple factors.
