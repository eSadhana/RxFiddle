\subsection{Validity}
\textbf{Subjects.} The online experiment was open to anyone who wanted to participate. As a result a mixed group of developers took part, even those without Rx experience. The total amount of participants filling in the preliminary survey for the experiment was larger than the group finishing the experiment.

\textbf{Tasks.} The experiment consists of 2 small and 2 medium tasks, so the results of the experiment might not necessarily generalize to debugging RP in practice with larger systems. For larger tasks the effects of the debugger could be bigger and therefore be better measurable. Still we chose for these smaller tasks, for two reasons: in the limited time of the subjects they could answer only so many questions and designing larger tasks for the experiment would take many more iterations and time. With the limited amount of time available we still show that a significant speed-up can be achieved in some cases. We leave it for future work to extend the experiment to include larger systems.
