\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\setheader{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank everyone involved in my thesis project for their support.
First of all, Erik Meijer, thank you for the opportunity to do a thesis about Rx,
inspiring me to use the \emph{hacker mentality} to create RxFiddle, and for
supporting me throughout this project, from across the Atlantic.

I want to thank Georgios Gousios for his belief in me, the opportunity to write
a paper instead of a report, and for his time, guidance, support and detailed feedback.
Thanks to Arie van Deursen for taking the time to be part of my thesis committee.

Furthermore I want to thank everyone at Codestar, in particular Joost de Vries,
Martin Weidner and David Hoepelman, for their time and support, the great discussions
at Friday\'s in Nieuwegein, and making this research possible. Joost and David, thank
you for getting me up to speed and keeping me on track, especially in those first
months when exploring the many possibilities ahead.

Thanks to Mark, Leonard, Rik, Joseph, Richard, Mike, Georgi and Eddy, and everyone
else who provided me with invaluable feedback during this project.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their support during my studies and my thesis.
